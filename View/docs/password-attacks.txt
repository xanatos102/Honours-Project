<h1>What is a Password Attack? </h1>
<p>A Password attack or password cracking is a form of hacking where the hacker will attempt to "break" a user’s password in order to gain access to their personal accounts and financial information. These attacks can come in many forms. </p>
<h1>Which types should I watch out for? </h1>
<p>There are 6 prominent attacks, which affect home users and professionals:</p>
<ol>
<h3><li>Dictionary attack</li></h3>
<p>An attack that takes advantage of the fact people tend to use common words and short passwords. The hacker uses a list of common words, the dictionary, and tries them, often with numbers before and/or after the words, against accounts. (Usernames are generally pretty easy to determine as they are almost universally based on the names of the user, especially in workplaces.) </p>
<h3><li>Brute force</li></h3>
<p>Using a program to generate likely passwords or even random character sets. These attacks start with commonly used, weak passwords like Password123 and move on from there. The programs running these attacks usually try variations on upper and lowercase characters, as well. </p>
<h3><li>Traffic interception</li></h3>
<p>In this attack, the cybercriminal uses software such as packet sniffers to monitor network traffic and capture passwords as they’re passed. Similar to eavesdropping or tapping a phone line, the software monitors and captures critical information. If that information, such as passwords, is unencrypted, the task is easier. But even encrypted information may be decryptable, depending on the strength of the encryption method used. </p>
<h3><li>Man in the Middle</li></h3>
<p>In this attack, the hacker’s program doesn’t just monitor information being passed but actively inserts itself in the middle of the interaction, usually by impersonating a website or app. This allows the program to capture the user’s credentials and other sensitive information, such as account numbers, social security numbers, etc. Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are often facilitated by social engineering attack methods which lure the user to a fake site, such as Phishing or Clickbait. </p>
<h3><li>Key logger attack</li></h3>
<p>A cybercriminal manages to install software that tracks the user’s keystrokes, enabling the criminal to gather not only the username and password for an account but exactly which website or app the user was logging into with the credentials. This type of attack generally relies on the user first falling prey to another attack that installs the malicious key logger software on their machine. </p>
<h3><li>Social engineering attacks</li></h3>
<p>Social engineering attacks refers to a broad range of methods to obtain information from users. Among the tactics used are:
<ul>
<li>Phishing: Emails, texts, etc. sent to fool users into providing their credentials, clicking a link that installs malicious software, or going to a fake website. </li>
<li>Spear phishing: Similar to phishing but with better crafted, tailored emails/texts which rely on information already gathered about the users. For example, the hacker may know that the user has a particular type of insurance account and reference it in the email or use the company’s logo and layout to make the email seem more legitimate. </li>
<li>Baiting: Attackers leave infected USBs or other devices in public or employer locations in the hopes they will be picked up and used by employees. </li>
<li>Quid pro quo: The cybercriminal impersonates someone, like a help desk employee, and interacts with a user in a way that requires getting information from them. </li>
</ul></p>
</ol>
<h1>How can I protect myself? </h1>
<p>Strong passwords are usually the first defense against password attacks. The best password is one that it easy to remember for the user and hard to guess for anyone else. A good mix of upper and lowercase characters, numbers, and special characters can help. Even better, avoid use of common words and common phrases. Definitely avoid site-specific words (including the name of the app you’re logging into in the password, for instance). It is also recommended checking passwords against a dictionary of known poor passwords. </p>
<p>Additionally, if a website employs a method of two-part or two-factor authentication it is recommended to use these technologies. Two-factor authentication uses a password or passcode known to the user as well as a unique randomly generated code, usually sent as a text message or email to a registered method set by the user to authenticate the user’s credentials. </p>
