<h1>What is computer malware? </h1>
<p>Computer malware, often referred to as a computer virus, is a broad term used to describe harmful computer software that is designed to infiltrate and damage computers without the users consent. </p>
<h1>Common types of computer malware. </h1>
<h3>Viruses</h3>
<p>A computer virus is a malicious piece of software that reproduces itself (self-replicating) over and over with the intent of infecting as many files and systems as it possibly can. Some viruses will infect their host immediately and some will lay dormant waiting for an event to trigger the virus. Not all viruses are built to destroy, but the common purpose of a virus is to destroy as many files as possible. Computer viruses never occur naturally and can only infect a device if they are downloaded or transferred from another device. Therefore, it is always important to take precautions when accessing data and information sources you do not know or trust.</p>
<h3>Worm</h3>
<p>A computer worm is similar to a virus as it too is self-replicating, however, worms don't typically destroy files. A worm’s purpose is to replicate itself so much that it makes the target device almost unusable, this is due to the device running out of resources and it not being able to cope with the amount of virus files within its processes and storage.<p>
<h3>Trojan</h3>
<p>A Trojan horse is a destructive computer program that pretends to be a safe and legitimate piece of software. Trojan horses do not replicate themselves like a traditional virus but they can still be as destructive. The term comes from a Greek story of the Trojan War, in which the Greeks give a giant wooden horse to their foes, the Trojans, as a peace offering. But after the Trojans drag the horse inside their city walls, Greek soldiers sneak out of the horse's hollow belly and open the city gates, allowing their compatriots to pour in and capture Troy.</p>
<h3>Adware</h3>
<p>Adware is the name given to viruses specifically contained in advertisement links and files. These viruses are programmed to infect the host device as soon as a user clicks on the advertisement. Common lures to attract users to click on the link include: Phishing attempts and Clickbait, which are discussed fully in additional articles.</p>
<h3>Ransomware</h3>
<p>Ransomware is a nasty piece of malware that prevents you from using your device and accessing certain files unless you pay a ransom. Ransomware works similar to a trojan virus, as it is usually accidently installed by the user thinking it is a legitimate piece of software. Once installed the ransomware program will often encrypt files making them inaccessible.</p>
<h3>Spyware</h3>
<p>As the name implies, spyware is a stealthy form of malware that sits on the user’s device. The purpose of this type of virus is not to destroy, but to observe the activities of the user and their device to transmit information to a source unknown to the user. Though not immediately destructive, spyware is dangerous as it can sit on a device for months to years without the user knowing of its existence, which by that point may be too late to resolve any stolen information or breaches to the user’s security.</p>
<h3>File-less Malware</h3>
<p>This is a dangerous and very difficult to detect piece of malware. File-less malware works by hijacking the communication between a device and piece of legitimate software.  Once the malware starts working, it stores itself in temporary storage spaces such as computer memory to do its job and disappear once the computer is done with the process. This interception in communication is usually the result of a user clicking a spam e-mail or other form of illegitimate link.</p>
<h3>Hybrid Malware</h3>
<p>Hybrid malware is potentially the most dangerous form of malware as it contains the “best” elements of other forms of malware making it difficult to detect and remove. Hybrid malware is very sophisticated in terms of design, therefore though it is dangerous, it requires a user with a very good understanding of hacking and code to write, making it less likely to be a threat currently. Though it is worth noting that as software tools evolve, hybrid malware will likely appear more and more frequently.</p>
<h1>How to protect yourself and your devices? </h1>
<ol>
<h3><li>Keep your computer/phone/tablet software up to date</li></h3>
<p>Software developers such as Microsoft, Apple, and Android offer regular updates for their apps. These updates typically come with a number of fixes, most important of these are the bug and security fixes, which left unresolved, could potentially be exploited by hackers. </p>
<p>It is recommended that you turn on automatic updates and notifications to keep your apps and devices up-to-date on important software changes and fixes. </p>
<h3><li>Use an antivirus software</li></h3>
<p>Antivirus and anti-malware products help to detect and remove potentially dangerous malware from your devices by scanning your computer for files with strange behaviors and patterns recognized by the software’s own virus database. Most antivirus and anti-malware products come in either free or subscription-based packages. The detection rates, features included and prices vary between provider, however, even a free antivirus software will help protect your device over nothing at all. </p>
<p>It is worth noting that the best defense against a potential virus attack is preventative measures. Don't click on websites that have questionable names and preview content. Don't click on email links you don't trust. Always keep your device up to date with the latest security patches and updates, and schedule automatic computer scans using your antivirus and anti-malware software. </p>
<h3><li>Do not click on unknown links within emails</li></h3>
<p>A useful feature that e-mail provides is the ability to visit a website by clicking on a URL link within the e-mail’s contents. It is convenient and saves the user having to type the address into a browser search bar manually. However, hackers have come to realize that it is a very quick and efficient way to infect a user’s computer, as the user does the hackers job for them. </p>
<p>Before clicking on a link inside an email, ask yourself: "Do I know who sent this e-mail?", "Does the e-mail look legitimate?", "Did I authorize the sender to send me this e-mail?". If the answer is no to any of these questions, then don't click on the link. Most hackers rely on the user to not check the e-mail properly before they click on the link. If you feel something is wrong don't click the link, you can always check the senders e-mail address against the details listed on the company’s website to make sure. </p>
<h3><li>Use a strong password for online accounts. </li></h3>
<p>When trying to gain access to an account a simple password is a hacker’s best friend. Hackers use various methods for cracking user passwords, the most common are software tools that run through a dictionary of words in hopes of guessing a suitable combination. When creating a password, it is advised that you do not use names and words related to people you know and your common interests. Simple passwords like "Password123", and "JohnSmith74" are able to be cracked in seconds, leaving your personal information open for use. </p>
<p>The strongest passwords are made up of a combination of lowercase and uppercase alphabetic characters, numbers, and special characters ($, #, @). It is worth noting that hacking tools are becoming much more sophisticated and a single password isn't always enough. If a website offers a two-part authentication process like a password and unique code, it is advisable to use this service. </p>
<h3><li>Use a firewall</li></h3>
<p>A common feature that is often forgotten on devices is a firewall. A firewall is a gateway on your device or router that blocks unauthorized content passing through your internet connection and reaching your device. A handy way to avoid infecting your device with malware, is restrict the type of content coming through the firewall. Details on how to do so can be found here: <a href="https://www.dummies.com/computers/pcs/computer-security/how-to-set-up-the-windows-firewall-on-your-pc/" target="_blank">Firewall Setup</a></p>
<h3><li>Back up your computer</li></h3>
<p>In the unfortunate event your device is compromised it is usually worth resetting it or rolling the device back to a point before the issues occurred. Therefore, it is a good idea to back up your important files, such as pictures, videos, and files onto an external hard drive or storage device. The frequency of these backups depends on your needs; however, it is recommended you backup a device at least every 2 to 4 weeks. </p>
<h3><li>Use pop-up blockers</li></h3>
<p>Pop-ups are small windows that suddenly appear on your device when browsing some webpages. They can be legitimate advertisements, though they are often frustrating to see once they block a piece of content you are trying to view. Most reputable sites will limit the number and frequency of pop-ups appearing on their site, which is usually a good indicator to a site’s credibility. It is worth noting however, that as with e-mail links, some pop-ups contain nasty viruses which can infect your device. Most anti-malware tools will come packaged with a pop-up blocking feature, however many browsers such as Firefox and Google Chrome offer pop-up blocking extensions to mitigate the number of pop-ups displayed. Again, if in doubt do not click! </p>
